<p>Your old styles and properties <em>might not work out of the box</em>. 
Some property names have been changed, noted below, as well as namespacing prefixes being applied to all elements. 
This means that <code>.flex-direction-nav .next</code> is now <code>.flex-direction-nav .flex-next</code> by default. 
The namespacing property is exposed, free for you to change.</p>
